# Template Skill

## Vibe Defaults

- Prefer fast iteration and shipping a working baseline over perfection.
- Make safe default choices without pausing; record assumptions briefly.
- Ask questions only after delivering an initial result, unless the workflow requires confirmation for safety/legal reasons.
- Keep outputs concise, actionable, and easy to extend.
- Assume the user is non-technical; avoid long explanations and provide copy/paste steps when actions are required.

## Vibe Fast Path

- Decide the simplest viable approach and execute immediately.
- Deliver a first pass before asking for corrections.
- Collect assumptions and questions for the end.

## Vibe Quick Invoke

- `use <skill-name>: <goal>`
